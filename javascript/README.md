# Today I Learned

This TIL repo is inspired by Khanh Nguyen from here on GitHub. He has a wonderful structure on his repo that provides a Table of Contents that includes topics and links to each file. I'm not sure I'll be sucessful in reproducing it here but many thanks Mr. Nguyen for the inspiration.

Today-I-Learned (TIL) is inspired by Thoughbot, TIL is a repository for everyone to share what we have learned today.
