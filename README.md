# Today I Learned

This TIL repo is inspired by Khanh Nguyen from here on GitHub. He has a wonderful Table of Contents structure on his repo. His also includes scripts that automate the process, for now I'm forgoing that portion and just looking to get started with good habits of adding things consistently. Many thanks Mr. Nguyen for the inspiration.

Today-I-Learned (TIL) is inspired by Thoughbot, TIL is a repository for everyone to share what we have learned today.
