# Today I Learned

This TIL repo is inspired by Khanh Nguyen.  He has a wonderful structure on his repo that provides a Table of Contents with topics and links to each file.  I'm not sure I'll be sucessful in reproducing it here but many thanks Mr. Nguyen for the inspiration.

TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining
concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.

Today-I-Learned (TIL) is inspired by Thoughbot, TIL is a repository for everyone to share what we have learned today.
